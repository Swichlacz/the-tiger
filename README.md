##My First Repo! Assignment 


This assignment is built around creating your first repository on Github and making some edits. Before you begin, you should take a moment to find a short poem, or part of a poem, that you can use in this assignment. Public Domain Poetry (Links to an external site.) is a site that has many great works you can safely use. Find a poem you can use and save the link.

Follow the directions below to create and share your repository.

Create a new repository
Login to Github and click the "Create New Repository" button in the upper right corner of the page:



 That will take you to a page where you can edit your new repo settings:



 

Github will always suggest a name for new repos, and for this assignment you can just go with the suggested name. Or give it a name of your own!

All repos default to Public, which is fine for our work. Although everyone can see the code, you still control who gets to modify the code in your projects. In general, it's better in a lot of ways to have code be public, especially when using third-party tools.

Finally, you can check the "Initialize this repository with a README" box. I have also selected an Apache v2 License. That part is optional.

Once you're happy with your settings, click "Create Repository". (Note: All the settings can be changed later, although it's generally not a good idea to change the name of an established repo.)

Add a file 
To enhance our repository, let's drop in a little poetry. Open the poem you found before you started this exercise so you can copy/paste the content and the URL.

After you click "Create Repository" you will land on the repository home page. This is the main page for the repo, and it looks something like this:



 To create a new file in your repository, click the plus button where it shows the repository path:

 

 

Once you click that button, you will be taken to a screen to edit your new file:

 In the top portion of the screen is the edit window. Since Github doesn't know what kind of file we're creating, it just shows us plain text entry. You could type or paste any kind of code or text in here. Don't forget to enter the filename in the box above the large text area.

Below the textarea you will see a couple of fields to leave a commit message. This is the message that will be shown in your repository's changelog. Try to make it informative, but don't worry too much about it:



Once you are satisfied with the content of your file and your commit message, click Commit New File. 

Alter your file
Github treats different kinds of files differently. View the README.md file and see how the page looks different: Instead of showing you the "plain text" version of the file, it shows you a formatted page. If you make edits and add text to this file, when you view it again it looks like a web page, not like code. This is because the file ends in a ".md" extension, which indicates it is a "Markdown" file. Markdown is a simple markup language that allows human-readable text files to be interpreted into prettier HTML.

Try altering the poem.txt file you created to use Markdown. First, view the file, then click the edit button:



Now, alter the name of the file you created to end in ".md" as shown:



Since your new file will be rendered into lovely HTML, take the opportunity to give it some flourish. Add a "#" to the beginning of the title in order to make it show up as a heading. You can highlight words with an asterisk (*) or underscore (_) in order to bold and italicize them. Any URLs you put into the document will automatically be converted into hyperlinks.

You can view a larger list of Markdown syntax on the Github Markdown basics page (Links to an external site.) or the official documentation (Links to an external site.). Feel free to explore as much as you want. Toggle between the "Code" and "Preview" panes in the editor to instantly see what your changes will look like. (Now is also a good time to fix any typos you managed to introduce on the last edit!) You must use at least 3 (three) Markdown formatting elements (try using headings, italics, bold, lists, etc.).



Once you have your poem formatted how you like it, commit the changes with a good, brief message. 

Post your results
Once you have completed editing your poem to look lovely, submit a brief statement along with the URL to your repository as described below:

A link to your repository
You repo can have any name
Your repo must have a "poem.md" file in it
Your "poem.md" file must have at least three markdown formatted elements (try using heading, URL, list, bold, italics, etc.)
Your "poem.md" file must have a link to wherever you found the poem that you are using
Some comment about how this assignment went. Was it tough? Did you find useful information elsewhere? (If so, give us links!)
