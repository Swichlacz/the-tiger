The Tiger

By William Blake

Tiger, tiger, burning _bright_<br>
In the forests of the _night_,<br>
What immortal hand or eye<br>
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?<br>

In what distant deeps or _skies_<br>
Burnt the fire of thine _eyes?_<br>
On what wings dare he aspire?<br>
What the hand dare seize the fire?<br>

And what shoulder and what _art_<br>
Could twist the sinews of thy _heart?_<br>
And, when thy heart began to beat,<br>
What dread hand and what dread feet?<br>

What the hammer? what the chain?<br>
In what furnace was thy brain?<br>
What the anvil? what dread grasp<br>
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?<br>

When the stars threw down their spears,<br>
And watered heaven with their tears,<br>
Did He smile His work to see?<br>
Did He who made the lamb make thee?<br>

Tiger, tiger, burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
